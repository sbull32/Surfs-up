# Surfs-up
Web Scraping with SQLAlchemy, SQLite and Flask

## Overview
We were tasked with providing analytics on a weather dataset for the island of Oahu, Hawaii in order to determine the feasablity of opening up a surf shop based on the weather conditions. More specifically we needed to discern the sustainablity of the business year round so we would analyze the weather data for the months of june and december

## Results

## Summary
Our analysis confirmed that temperatures on the island of Oahu are sustainable year round for surfing meaning our shop might be worth opening. In order to provide more in depth analysis we should analyze more features including precipitation amounts and customer tendencies such as visitors to the island during the year. We could also research locations on the island to better discern where exactly we should place our store.
